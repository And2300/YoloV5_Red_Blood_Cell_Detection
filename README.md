# YoloV5_Red_Blood_Cell_Detection
YoloV5 for Red Blood Cell Detection in Pytorch

This repository is an update of our first work done in tensorflow1, now in Pytorch and with YoloV5.

The training data is from https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset.

Conversions from xml to txt were done in https://roboflow.com/convert/pascal-voc-xml-to-yolov5-pytorch-txt

It's really exciting to see what once took many lines of code can now be done in just a few.

You can ask us through github.
